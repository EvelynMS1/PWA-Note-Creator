# PWA-Note-Creator ![license](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)

## Description

The purpose of creating this project was for making use of the service worker as it is a tool that will possibly be used in future projects. This project solves the problem of allowing a user to use an application through the process of downloading the application. I learned that though a webpack package along with the npmrc package the service worker functionality can be integrated.
